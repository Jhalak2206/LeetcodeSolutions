Concept:

A prefix sum array is a data structure where each element at index i is the sum of all elements in the original array up to index i.  Given an array arr, its prefix sum array prefixSum is calculated as:

prefixSum[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i]

Applications:

Range Sum Queries: Efficiently calculate the sum of elements within a given range in an array.

Finding Equilibrium Index: Determine if there's an index in an array where the sum of elements to the left equals the sum of elements to the right.

Solving Array Problems: Simplifies many array-related problems, reducing time complexity.
