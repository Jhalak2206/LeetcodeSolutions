Bit manipulation involves performing operations directly on the individual bits of binary representations of numbers.  Instead of treating numbers as abstract values, bit manipulation works at the most fundamental level of data representation.

Advantages in Algorithm Design:

Efficiency: Bitwise operations are extremely fast, often requiring only a single CPU cycle.  This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially in time-critical applications.

Space Optimization: Bit manipulation can be used to represent multiple states or flags within a single integer, reducing memory usage.  For example, a single 32-bit integer can hold 32 boolean values.

Conciseness: Some algorithms can be expressed more concisely and elegantly using bit manipulation, leading to shorter and more readable code.

Solving Specific Problems: Bit manipulation is essential for solving certain types of problems, such as those involving:

Low-level hardware manipulation.

Cryptography.

Error detection and correction.

Compression algorithms.

Optimization problems.

Common Bitwise Operators:

AND (&): Sets a bit to 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.

OR (|): Sets a bit to 1 if either or both corresponding bits are 1.

XOR (^): Sets a bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.

NOT (~): Inverts all the bits of a number.

Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits to the left, filling the vacated positions with 0s. (Multiplies by powers of 2)

Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right.  (Divides by powers of 2)

Unsigned Right Shift (>>>): Shifts bits to the right, filling the vacated positions with 0s.
